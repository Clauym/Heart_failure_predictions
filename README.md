# Heart Failure Predictions



### Questions:
1. How sex affects heart failure deaths?
2. Are there noticeable different factors between the people dead by heart failure and those who don't?
3. Is there a model that estimates the outcomes better (we will test 2 models at least)?
4. At what age are people having the highest probability of a heart failure in this dataset?

You can find the .csv data [HERE](/Resources/HF_clinical_records_dataset.csv).
