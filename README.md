# Brain Stroke Predictions



### Questions:
1. How sex affects brain stroke deaths?
2. Are there noticeable different factors between the people dead by brain stroke and those who do not?
3. Is there a model that estimates the outcomes better (we will test 2 models at least)?
4. At what age are people having the highest probability of a brain stroke in this dataset?

You can preview the brain stroke data set (.csv) used on this project [HERE](/Resources/brain_stroke_data.csv). To download the original data set click [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zzettrkalpakbal/full-filled-brain-stroke-dataset/download?datasetVersionNumber=2).
